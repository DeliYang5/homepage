title: "Does Generative AI Facilitate Trading? Evidence from Cryptocurrency"
collection: Working Paper

# permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: In this paper, we investigate the impact of generative AI on investors’ trading behaviors and market liquidity. We develop a microstructure model with overconfident investors and use ChatGPT outrages to find empirical support from crypto markets. Theoretically, we find that the impact of GAI depends on the level of overconfidence and private information quality. If the private signal precision is low but overconfidence is high, GAI can reduce over-trading and market depth by increasing informed trading and reducing behavioral biases. If the private signal precision is high and overconfidence is low, GAI can increase trading and market depth by introducing GAI noise into investors’ information sets. Using ChatGPT outages as an exogenous shock to GAI accessibility, we first document a significant increase in trading volume and the effect is stronger for periods with higher average return. We further document similar increases in return volatility and price range. These empirical evidences indicate that (1) GAI is widely adopted to assist crypto trading; (2) crypto investors are generally overconfident; (3) GAI can moderate investors’ behavioral biases and over-trading. Overall, our framework and empirical findings contribute to the debate on the impact of AI trading models on market and its welfare effects.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of generative AI on investors’ trading behaviors and market liquidity. We develop a microstructure model with overconfident investors and use ChatGPT outrages to find empirical support from crypto markets. Theoretically, we find that the impact of GAI depends on the level of overconfidence and private information quality. If the private signal precision is low but overconfidence is high, GAI can reduce over-trading and market depth by increasing informed trading and reducing behavioral biases. If the private signal precision is high and overconfidence is low, GAI can increase trading and market depth by introducing GAI noise into investors’ information sets. Using ChatGPT outages as an exogenous shock to GAI accessibility, we first document a significant increase in trading volume and the effect is stronger for periods with higher average return. We further document similar increases in return volatility and price range. These empirical evidences indicate that (1) GAI is widely adopted to assist crypto trading; (2) crypto investors are generally overconfident; (3) GAI can moderate investors’ behavioral biases and over-trading. Overall, our framework and empirical findings contribute to the debate on the impact of AI trading models on market and its welfare effects.
