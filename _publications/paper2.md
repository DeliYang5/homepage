title: "Disaster Do Disastrous Folklores Affect Modern Environmental Protections?"
collection: Manuscript
category: Working Paper
# permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: This study considers whether a community’s ancient verbal traditions shape its environmental and societal (E&S) values. We find that companies that locate in regions with folklores containing disastrous wordings invest more in infrastructure and initiatives to reduce environmental pollutions and therefore exhibit better E&S performance. This finding is mainly driven by folklores that describe imaginary and mythical disasters, by areas with less foreign cultural influence and more severe seismic risk. Further tests reveal that residents in regions with disastrous folklore lean toward left-wing politically and exhibit greater environmental concerns. Our results suggest that a region’s historical perception of catastrophe, even when it is imaginary, has significant influence over its residents’ philosophy toward environmental and societal values in present time.
