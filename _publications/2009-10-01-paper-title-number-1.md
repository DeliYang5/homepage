excerpt: 'Abstract: This paper studies whether investors' abnormal attention drives the beta anomaly in China. We find that a) investors pay more attention to high beta stocks, b) the beta anomaly is only significant among stocks with high attention. Further tests suggest investors' abnormal attention to high beta stocks leads to price pressure. Lack of short-selling, the bubbles accumulated and resulting in the low performance of high beta stocks.'
